# LLZomboLewd
A community mod for Project Zomboid for LoversLab (+18). Name is temporary, this Github purpose is to create a community of Project Zomboid modders from LoversLab. Everybody is welcome and every works will be appreciated. The actual release is a very early ALPHA, please be mindful, expect many glitches.

Do note that the animations here are placeholder. They are rough around the edges since we are not animators ourselves but they do not represent the intended animation quality. If you are a skilled animator, you can easily make smooth animations that rivals other frameworks.
